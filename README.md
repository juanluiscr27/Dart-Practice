# Dart-Practice
Practice codes for Dart programming language, including language fundamentals, intermediate and advanced topics.

Learn the Dart programming language in this full tutorial for beginners. Dart is a strictly typed programming language that is used in the Flutter framework to develop cross platform mobile apps.

Since Dart supports both AOT (Ahead of time) and JIT (Just In Time) compilation, it delivers extremely fast development cycles and fast execution and startup times. It is a compiled programming language and can also transpile the code into JavaScript. (freeCodeCamp.org)
